Our project
-----------
The [Workflow4Metabolomics](http://workflow4metabolomics.org), W4M in short, is a French infrastructure offering software tool processing, analyzing and annotating metabolomics data. It is based on the Galaxy platform.

In the context of collaboration between metabolomics ([MetaboHUB French infrastructure](http://www.metabohub.fr/index.php?lang=fr)) and bioinformatics platforms ([IFB: Institut Français de Bioinformatique](http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en)), we have developed full LC/MS, GC/MS and NMR pipelines using Galaxy framework for data analysis including preprocessing, normalization, quality control, statistical analysis and annotation steps. Those modular and extensible workflows are composed with existing components (XCMS and CAMERA packages, etc.) but also a whole suite of complementary homemade tools. This implementation is accessible through a web interface, which guarantees the parameters completeness. The advanced features of Galaxy have made possible the integration of components from different sources and of different types. Thus, an extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is offered to metabolomics communities (platforms, end users, etc.), and enables preconfigured workflows sharing for new users, but also experts in the field.
